Why this role matters
You’ll be the first dedicated Product Analyst at LimeChat. Your analyses will decide what we build, how we launch, and whether we double‑down or pivot. If turning raw event streams into sharp product strategy excites you, read on.
What you’ll do
Own funnel analytics: Map activation → engagement → retention journeys; identify friction and craft data‑backed recommendations.
Design experiments: Partner with PMs to run A/B & multivariate tests; crunch results and translate into roadmap actions.
Define metrics: Establish north‑star KPIs and supporting dashboards in Metabase/Looker so every squad can self‑serve insights.
Revenue impact modelling: Forecast payback of new features, price changes, and GTM campaigns; quantify incremental MRR/NRR.
Data quality stewardship: Write tracking specs, QA event streams, and work with Engineers to keep our Snowflake/BigQuery tidy.
Cross‑functional enablement: Feed customer‑level insights to Growth & CS for upsells/churn saves; support founders with board decks.
Must‑haves
1–3 yrs in product/growth analytics or data‑driven product ops for SaaS or B2B products.
Expert in SQL (window functions, CTEs, optimisation) and fluent with at least one BI tool (Metabase, Looker, Power BI, Amplitude, Mixpanel).
Strong grasp of product metrics (DAU, WAU, MAU, retention curves, LTV, payback) and experimentation theory (power, significance, lift).
Ability to break down ambiguous problems, choose the right methods, and communicate insights in plain English.
Curiosity + ownership—you spot anomalies before the PM does and chase them till root cause.
Nice‑to‑have
Python/R for advanced analysis (p‑stats, cohort modelling) or quick notebooks.
Experience with event pipelines (Segment, RudderStack) and cloud warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).
Knowledge of subscription/SaaS finance metrics (MRR, NRR, CAC, payback) and pricing analytics.
Familiarity with LLM usage metrics and prompt evaluation would be a bonus.
